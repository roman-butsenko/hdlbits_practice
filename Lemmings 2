/* 
In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the
Lemming will fall and say "aaah!". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume
walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the
walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling),
or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.
*/

/*
one-hot and derived by inspection (didn't work properly,
entered walk_left and walk_right simoltaniously

I figured it. There should be sparate states for falling right and falling left.
But this wasn't implemented, I've desided to solve this task with more traditional FSM
just for the sake of practice
